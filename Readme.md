# ANN_CornBunting
This is a tutorial for using using Artificual Neural Networks in R. It was developed by Francesco Maria Sabatini, in occasion of a guest lecture at the Hochschule für Nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde, 26 June, 2020. 

The goals of this tutorial are:
* to understand the concept of artificial neural networks (in this case particularly the multilayer perceptron)
* to analyse a comprehensive data set of various meteorological variables and structural parameters (measurements) representing the habitat suitability of the bird family “corn bunting” (Emberiza calandra) with the help of artificial neural networks
* to derive an appropriate prediction model for analyzing and interpreting the given value
* to interpret the resulting analysis and prediction results
* to visualize prediction results in a spatial context with geographic coordinates
